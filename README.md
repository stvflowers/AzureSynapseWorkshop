# Azure Synapse Analytics Enablement Workshop

## Summary

The goal of this repository is to provide the attendees with a 3-hour workshop to introduce Synapse. The schedule below outlines a strict schedule for delivering the workshop. The goal is to provide presentation materials as well as light hands-on work to introduce Synapse to the audience.


## Schedule

Task|Time|Goal
----|----|----
Introductions | 15 min | Introductions are important to understand the audience. Who is in attendance? What is their role? Do you need to increase or decrease the technical content of the session?
Presentation: Azure Synapse Analytics | 30 min | Presentation to introduce the high-level components of Synapse and how they are positioned in the Modern Data Architecture.
Hands on: Create workspace, analyze with Serverless Pools and Spark | 30 min | Work through creating a workspace and getting started with Serverless pools and Spark pools.
Break | 15 min
Hands on: Analyze using Dedicated SQL pools | 15 min | Create a dedicated SQL pool and begin working with the pool. For hosts of the workshop, make sure the audience is clear on the differences between Serverless and Dedicated at this point.
Hands on: Analyze data in a storage account | 15 min | This module is focused on interacting with files in ADLS.
Hands on: Integrate with pipelines and Power BI | 15 min | Introduction to the orchestration features of Synapse Pipelines
Challenges | 15 min | 3 tasks to complete to show and understanding of Synapse.
Open discussion | 30 min | This is reserved for Question and Answer. However, if the audience has experience with Synapse or big data analytics it would be best to get a list of questions the team may have in advance. This time can be used to tackle specific questions such as when to choose Synapse Spark or Databricks.
